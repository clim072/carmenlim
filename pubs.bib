	abstract = {Background and Aims There has been an increase in the potency of cannabis during the last two decades and adoption of a novel method of administration—vaping. YouTube, a social media platform, has become a popular source to access cannabis-related information. This study aimed to identify cannabis vaping YouTube videos from 2016 to 2020 and examine the themes and metrics. Design Cross-sectional sample of 200 YouTube videos. Setting YouTube, an on-line video sharing platform. Measurements Videos related to cannabis vaping were identified using the search terms: ‘vaping cannabis’, ‘vaping weed’, ‘vaping marijuana’ and ‘vaping THC’ [tetrahydrocannabinol]. Videos were independently coded by two researchers. The number of views, likes, dislikes and comments were also collected. Robust regression was used to analyse the relationship between identified video themes and video metrics. Findings Six themes were identified: ‘advertisement’, ‘product review’, ‘celebratory’, ‘reflective’, ‘how-to’ and ‘warning’. The ‘how-to’ and ‘celebratory’ videos received the highest number of views and likes. The most popular video was viewed more than 4 000 000 times. Many videos portrayed risky behaviour (e.g. vaping a whole THC cartridge in a single setting). Fifty-two percent of these videos had no age access restrictions. The robust regression model also found that engagement metric was positively associated with ‘reflective’ videos and negatively associated with ‘advertisement’ videos. Conclusions A large number of videos on cannabis vaping are available on-line without age-restriction. Videos that portrayed risky behaviour appear to be prevalent.},

	abstract = {Introduction and aims More Australians are in favour of legalising medical and recreational cannabis use. This paper explored the personal characteristics of those who supported each of these policies in Australia. Design Cross-sectional national survey. Methods This study included 21,729 participants aged 18 years and above who responded to the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships between personal characteristics and support for the legalisation of medical and recreational cannabis. Results Overall, 77\% and 40\% of participants supported the legalisation of medical and recreational cannabis respectively. People of older age were more likely to support medical cannabis legalisation while those who supported legalisation of recreational cannabis use were more likely to be younger. Medical cannabis supporters were more likely to report chronic pain (OR= 1.44, 95\% CI: 1.04, 2.00) while recreational cannabis supporters were more likely to suffer high level of psychological distress (OR=1.28, 95\% CI: 1.14, 1.43). Experience with cannabis use was strongly associated with supportive attitudes, with recent cannabis users almost 14 times (OR=14.13, 95\% CI: 5.37, 37.20) and 34 times (OR= 33.74, 95\% CI: 24.22, 47.01) more likely to support the legalisation of medical and recreational cannabis use respectively. Discussion and conclusions The majority of Australians approve the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes but most remain cautious about legalising recreational cannabis use. The sociodemographic and clinical profile of supporters of medical and recreational legalisation reflects an interaction of self-interests and beliefs about the harms of cannabis use.},

	abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had increased population-level anxiety and had elicited panic buying behaviour across the world. The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention. In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic buying of toilet paper during the crisis. Methods: A total of 255,171 tweets were collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic. Conclusions: Social media data can provide rapid infodemiology of public mental health. In a pandemic or crisis situation, real-time data could be monitored and content-analysed for authorities to promptly address public concerns.},

	abstract = {Aim
E-cigarettes, or nicotine vaping products, are potential smoking cessation aids that provide both nicotine and behavioural substitution for combustible cigarette smoking. This review aims to compare the effectiveness of nicotine e-cigarettes for smoking cessation with licensed nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) and nicotine-free based control conditions by using network meta-analysis (NMA).
Methods
We searched PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated individuals to use nicotine e-cigarettes, compared to those that used licensed NRT (e.g., nicotine patches, nicotine gums, etc), or a nicotine-free control condition such as receiving placebo (nicotine-free) e-cigarettes or usual care. We only included studies of healthy individuals who smoked. Furthermore, we identified the latest Cochrane review on NRT and searched NRT trials that were published in similar periods as the e-cigarette trials we identified. NMA was conducted to compare the effect of e-cigarettes on cessation relative to NRT and control condition. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials Version 2 was used to access study bias.
Results
For the e-cigarette trials, our initial search identified 4,717 studies and we included 7 trials for NMA after removal of duplicates, record screening and assessment of eligibility (Total N = 5,674). For NRT trials, our initial search identified 1,014 studies and we included 9 trials that satisfied our inclusion criteria (Total N = 6,080). Results from NMA indicated that participants assigned to use nicotine e-cigarettes were more likely to remain abstinent from smoking than those in the control condition (pooled Risk Ratio (RR) = 2.08, 97.5\% CI = [1.39, 3.15]) and those who were assigned to use NRT (pooled RR = 1.49, 97.5\% CI = [1.04, 2.14]. There was a moderate heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 42\%). Most of the e-cigarette trials has moderate or high risk of bias.
Conclusion
Smokers assigned to use nicotine e-cigarettes were more likely to remain abstinent from smoking than those assigned to use licensed NRT, and both were more effective than usual care or placebo conditions. More high quality studies are required to ascertain the effect of e-cigarette on smoking cessation due to risk of bias in the included studies.},

	abstract = {Background
Personal vaporisers are gaining popularity as an alternative route of administration for a range of substances. Online cryptomarkets are becoming increasingly popular among people who use substances due to their perceived anonymity, ease of use, and reduced risk of violence compared to traditional face-to-face dealers. We examined the diversity of substances marketed for use in a personal vaporiser on these marketplaces.
Methods
Vaping related listings were extracted from three online cryptomarkets (‘Agartha’, ‘Cryptonia’, and ‘Tochka’) using The Onion Router browser. Data collection occurred between October and November 2019.
Results
We identified 1929 listings from 201 unique sellers. The top product on Agartha, Cryptonia, and Tochka were vape cartridges prefilled with the e-liquid (70.4 \%, 39.4 \%, 52.3 \% respectively). The most common substance in these products was cannabis oil (96.1 \%, 82.1 \%, 87.8 \%), followed by synthetic cannabinoids (3.7 \%, 9.7 \%, 9.8 \%) and psychedelic substances (0.2 \%, 6.4 \%, 1.2 \%). Vendors were primarily from the USA. Many products offered worldwide shipping (96.3 \%, 42.4 \%, 51.2 \%).
Conclusion
Vaping products listed on online cryptomarkets in 2019 primarily contained cannabis oils. Future studies should continue to examine cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of substances that can be used in personal vaporisers.},
