abstract: 'Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had increased
  population-level anxiety and had elicited panic buying behaviour across the world.
  The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention.
  In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic
  buying of toilet paper during the crisis. Methods: A total of 255,171 tweets were
  collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly
  selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets
  in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until
  saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1)
  humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4)
  personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried
  negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet
  paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most
  influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the
  2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social
  media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel
  psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media
  posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety
  and panic. Conclusions: Social media data can provide rapid infodemiology of public
  mental health. In a pandemic or crisis situation, real-time data could be monitored
  and content-analysed for authorities to promptly address public concerns.'
