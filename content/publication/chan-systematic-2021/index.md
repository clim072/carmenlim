abstract: Aim E-cigarettes, or nicotine vaping products, are potential smoking cessation
  aids that provide both nicotine and behavioural substitution for combustible cigarette
  smoking. This review aims to compare the effectiveness of nicotine e-cigarettes
  for smoking cessation with licensed nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) and nicotine-free
  based control conditions by using network meta-analysis (NMA). Methods We searched
  PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that
  allocated individuals to use nicotine e-cigarettes, compared to those that used
  licensed NRT (e.g., nicotine patches, nicotine gums, etc), or a nicotine-free control
  condition such as receiving placebo (nicotine-free) e-cigarettes or usual care.
  We only included studies of healthy individuals who smoked. Furthermore, we identified
  the latest Cochrane review on NRT and searched NRT trials that were published in
  similar periods as the e-cigarette trials we identified. NMA was conducted to compare
  the effect of e-cigarettes on cessation relative to NRT and control condition. Cochrane
  risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials Version 2 was used to access study bias.
  Results For the e-cigarette trials, our initial search identified 4,717 studies
  and we included 7 trials for NMA after removal of duplicates, record screening and
  assessment of eligibility (Total N = 5,674). For NRT trials, our initial search
  identified 1,014 studies and we included 9 trials that satisfied our inclusion criteria
  (Total N = 6,080). Results from NMA indicated that participants assigned to use
  nicotine e-cigarettes were more likely to remain abstinent from smoking than those
  in the control condition (pooled Risk Ratio (RR) = 2.08, 97.5% CI = [1.39, 3.15])
  and those who were assigned to use NRT (pooled RR = 1.49, 97.5% CI = [1.04, 2.14].
  There was a moderate heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 42%). Most of the e-cigarette
  trials has moderate or high risk of bias. Conclusion Smokers assigned to use nicotine
  e-cigarettes were more likely to remain abstinent from smoking than those assigned
  to use licensed NRT, and both were more effective than usual care or placebo conditions.
  More high quality studies are required to ascertain the effect of e-cigarette on
  smoking cessation due to risk of bias in the included studies.
