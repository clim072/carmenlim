abstract: Background  Traumatic events are associated with increased risk of psychotic
  experiences, but it is unclear whether this association is explained by mental disorders
  prior to psychotic experience onset.    Aims  To investigate the associations between
  traumatic events and subsequent psychotic experience onset after adjusting for post-traumatic
  stress disorder and other mental disorders.    Method  We assessed 29 traumatic
  event types and psychotic experiences from the World Mental Health surveys and examined
  the associations of traumatic events with subsequent psychotic experience onset
  with and without adjustments for mental disorders.    Results  Respondents with
  any traumatic events had three times the odds of other respondents of subsequently
  developing psychotic experiences (OR=3.1, 95% CI 2.7–3.7), with variability in strength
  of association across traumatic event types. These associations persisted after
  adjustment for mental disorders.    Conclusions  Exposure to traumatic events predicts
  subsequent onset of psychotic experiences even after adjusting for comorbid mental
  disorders.
