abstract: Background and Aims Studies have consistently found a longitudinal association
  between e-cigarette use (vaping) and cigarette smoking. Many have interpreted such
  association as causal. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the plausibility
  of a causal interpretation by (1) estimating the effect of adolescent vaping on
  smoking initiation, adjusted for study quality characteristics, (2) evaluating the
  sufficiency of adjustment for confounding based on the social development model
  (SDM) and the social ecological model (SEM) and E-value analyses and (3) investigating
  sample attrition and publication bias. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis
  of longitudinal studies that examined the association between e-cigarette use at
  baseline and smoking at follow-up. Participants were non-smokers aged textless 18
  at baseline. Results Meta-analysis of 11 studies showed a significant longitudinal
  association between vaping and smoking [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.93, 95% confidence
  interval (CI) = 2.22, 3.87]. Studies with sample sizes textless 1000 had a significantly
  higher odds ratio (OR = 6.68, 95% CI = 3.63, 12.31) than studies with sample sizes
  textgreater 1000 (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.97, 3.15). Overall, the attrition rate was
  very high (median = 30%). All but one study reported results from complete sample
  analysis, despite those dropping out having higher risk profiles. Only two studies
  comprehensively adjusted for confounding. The median E-value was 2.90, indicating
  that the estimates were not robust against unmeasured confounding. Conclusions There
  is a longitudinal association between adolescent vaping and smoking initiation;
  however, the evidence is limited by publication bias, high sample attrition and
  inadequate adjustment for potential confounders.
