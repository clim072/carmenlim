abstract: Background  Although there is robust evidence linking childhood adversities
  (CAs) and an increased risk for psychotic experiences (PEs), little is known about
  whether these associations vary across the life-course and whether mental disorders
  that emerge prior to PEs explain these associations.    Method  We assessed CAs,
  PEs and DSM-IV mental disorders in 23 998 adults in the WHO World Mental Health
  Surveys. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to investigate the associations
  between CAs and PEs, and the influence of mental disorders on these associations
  using multivariate logistic models.    Results  Exposure to CAs was common, and
  those who experienced any CAs had increased odds of later PEs [odds ratio (OR) 2.3,
  95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9–2.6]. CAs reflecting maladaptive family functioning
  (MFF), including abuse, neglect, and parent maladjustment, exhibited the strongest
  associations with PE onset in all life-course stages. Sexual abuse exhibited a strong
  association with PE onset during childhood (OR 8.5, 95% CI 3.6–20.2), whereas Other
  CA types were associated with PE onset in adolescence. Associations of other CAs
  with PEs disappeared in adolescence after adjustment for prior-onset mental disorders.
  The population attributable risk proportion (PARP) for PEs associated with all CAs
  was 31% (24% for MFF).    Conclusions  Exposure to CAs is associated with PE onset
  throughout the life-course, although sexual abuse is most strongly associated with
  childhood-onset PEs. The presence of mental disorders prior to the onset of PEs
  does not fully explain these associations. The large PARPs suggest that preventing
  CAs could lead to a meaningful reduction in PEs in the population.
