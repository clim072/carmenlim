abstract: 'Abstract   Aims  To identify and synthesise the literature on the cost
  of mental disorders.    Methods  Systematic literature searches were conducted in
  the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, EconLit, NHS York Database and PsychInfo
  using key terms for cost and mental disorders. Searches were restricted to January
  1980â€“May 2019. The inclusion criteria were: (1) cost-of-illness studies or cost-analyses;
  (2) diagnosis of at least one mental disorder; (3) study population based on the
  general population; (4) outcome in monetary units. The systematic review was preregistered
  on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019127783).    Results   In total, 13 579 potential titles
  and abstracts were screened and 439 full-text articles were evaluated by two independent
  reviewers. Of these, 112 articles were included from the systematic searches and
  31 additional articles from snowball searching, resulting in 143 included articles.
  Data were available from 48 countries and categorised according to nine mental disorder
  groups. The quality of the studies varied widely and there was a lack of studies
  from low- and middle-income countries and for certain types of mental disorders
  (e.g. intellectual disabilities and eating disorders). Our study showed that certain
  groups of mental disorders are more costly than others and that these rankings are
  relatively stable between countries. An interactive data visualisation site can
  be found here:  https://nbepi.com/econ  .     Conclusions  This is the first study
  to provide a comprehensive overview of the cost of mental disorders worldwide.'
