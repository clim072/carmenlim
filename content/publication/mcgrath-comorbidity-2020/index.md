abstract: Abstract   Aims  Epidemiological studies indicate that individuals with
  one type of mental disorder have an increased risk of subsequently developing other
  types of mental disorders. This study aimed to undertake a comprehensive analysis
  of pair-wise lifetime comorbidity across a range of common mental disorders based
  on a diverse range of population-based surveys.    Methods  The WHO World Mental
  Health (WMH) surveys assessed 145 990 adult respondents from 27 countries. Based
  on retrospectively-reported age-of-onset for 24 DSM-IV mental disorders, associations
  were examined between all 548 logically possible temporally-ordered disorder pairs.
  Overall and time-dependent hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
  were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute risks were estimated
  using the product-limit method. Estimates were generated separately for men and
  women.    Results  Each prior lifetime mental disorder was associated with an increased
  risk of subsequent first onset of each other disorder. The median HR was 12.1 (mean
  = 14.4; range 5.2–110.8, interquartile range = 6.0–19.4). The HRs were most prominent
  between closely-related mental disorder types and in the first 1–2 years after the
  onset of the prior disorder. Although HRs declined with time since prior disorder,
  significantly elevated risk of subsequent comorbidity persisted for at least 15
  years. Appreciable absolute risks of secondary disorders were found over time for
  many pairs.    Conclusions  Survey data from a range of sites confirms that comorbidity
  between mental disorders is common. Understanding the risks of temporally secondary
  disorders may help design practical programs for primary prevention of secondary
  disorders.
