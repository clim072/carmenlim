abstract: Background  Although specific phobia is highly prevalent, associated with
  impairment, and an important risk factor for the development of other mental disorders,
  cross-national epidemiological data are scarce, especially from low- and middle-income
  countries. This paper presents epidemiological data from 22 low-, lower-middle-,
  upper-middle- and high-income countries.    Method   Data came from 25 representative
  population-based surveys conducted in 22 countries (2001–2011) as part of the World
  Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys initiative (  n  = 124 902). The
  presence of specific phobia as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
  of Mental Disorders, fourth edition was evaluated using the World Health Organization
  Composite International Diagnostic Interview.     Results  The cross-national lifetime
  and 12-month prevalence rates of specific phobia were, respectively, 7.4% and 5.5%,
  being higher in females (9.8 and 7.7%) than in males (4.9% and 3.3%) and higher
  in high- and higher-middle-income countries than in low-/lower-middle-income countries.
  The median age of onset was young (8 years). Of the 12-month patients, 18.7% reported
  severe role impairment (13.3–21.9% across income groups) and 23.1% reported any
  treatment (9.6–30.1% across income groups). Lifetime co-morbidity was observed in
  60.5% of those with lifetime specific phobia, with the onset of specific phobia
  preceding the other disorder in most cases (72.6%). Interestingly, rates of impairment,
  treatment use and co-morbidity increased with the number of fear subtypes.    Conclusions  Specific
  phobia is common and associated with impairment in a considerable percentage of
  cases. Importantly, specific phobia often precedes the onset of other mental disorders,
  making it a possible early-life indicator of psychopathology vulnerability.
