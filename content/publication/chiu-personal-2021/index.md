abstract: 'Introduction and aims More Australians are in favour of legalising medical
  and recreational cannabis use. This paper explored the personal characteristics
  of those who supported each of these policies in Australia. Design Cross-sectional
  national survey. Methods This study included 21,729 participants aged 18 years and
  above who responded to the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey. Logistic
  regression models were used to examine the relationships between personal characteristics
  and support for the legalisation of medical and recreational cannabis. Results Overall,
  77% and 40% of participants supported the legalisation of medical and recreational
  cannabis respectively. People of older age were more likely to support medical cannabis
  legalisation while those who supported legalisation of recreational cannabis use
  were more likely to be younger. Medical cannabis supporters were more likely to
  report chronic pain (OR= 1.44, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.00) while recreational cannabis supporters
  were more likely to suffer high level of psychological distress (OR=1.28, 95% CI:
  1.14, 1.43). Experience with cannabis use was strongly associated with supportive
  attitudes, with recent cannabis users almost 14 times (OR=14.13, 95% CI: 5.37, 37.20)
  and 34 times (OR= 33.74, 95% CI: 24.22, 47.01) more likely to support the legalisation
  of medical and recreational cannabis use respectively. Discussion and conclusions
  The majority of Australians approve the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes
  but most remain cautious about legalising recreational cannabis use. The sociodemographic
  and clinical profile of supporters of medical and recreational legalisation reflects
  an interaction of self-interests and beliefs about the harms of cannabis use.'
