abstract: Abstract   Background  The patterns of comorbidity among mental disorders
  have led researchers to model the underlying structure of psychopathology. While
  studies have suggested a structure including internalizing and externalizing disorders,
  less is known with regard to the cross-national stability of this model. Moreover,
  little data are available on the placement of eating disorders, bipolar disorder
  and psychotic experiences (PEs) in this structure.    Methods   We evaluated the
  structure of mental disorders with data from the World Health Organization Composite
  International Diagnostic Interview, including 15 lifetime mental disorders and six
  PEs. Respondents (  n  = 5478â€“15 499) were included from 10 high-, middle- and lower
  middle-income countries across the world aged 18 years or older. Confirmatory factor
  analyses (CFAs) were used to evaluate and compare the fit of different factor structures
  to the lifetime disorder data. Measurement invariance was evaluated with multigroup
  CFA (MG-CFA).     Results  A second-order model with internalizing and externalizing
  factors and fear and distress subfactors best described the structure of common
  mental disorders. MG-CFA showed that this model was stable across countries. Of
  the uncommon disorders, bipolar disorder and eating disorder were best grouped with
  the internalizing factor, and PEs with a separate factor.    Conclusions  These
  results indicate that cross-national patterns of lifetime common mental-disorder
  comorbidity can be explained with a second-order underlying structure that is stable
  across countries and can be extended to also cover less common mental disorders.
