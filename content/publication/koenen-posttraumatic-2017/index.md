abstract: Background  Traumatic events are common globally; however, comprehensive
  population-based cross-national data on the epidemiology of posttraumatic stress
  disorder (PTSD), the paradigmatic trauma-related mental disorder, are lacking.    Methods  Data
  were analyzed from 26 population surveys in the World Health Organization World
  Mental Health Surveys. A total of 71 083 respondents ages 18+ participated. The
  Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed exposure to traumatic events
  as well as 30-day, 12-month, and lifetime PTSD. Respondents were also assessed for
  treatment in the 12 months preceding the survey. Age of onset distributions were
  examined by country income level. Associations of PTSD were examined with country
  income, world region, and respondent demographics.    Results  The cross-national
  lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 3.9% in the total sample and 5.6% among the trauma
  exposed. Half of respondents with PTSD reported persistent symptoms. Treatment seeking
  in high-income countries (53.5%) was roughly double that in low-lower middle income
  (22.8%) and upper-middle income (28.7%) countries. Social disadvantage, including
  younger age, female sex, being unmarried, being less educated, having lower household
  income, and being unemployed, was associated with increased risk of lifetime PTSD
  among the trauma exposed.    Conclusions  PTSD is prevalent cross-nationally, with
  half of all global cases being persistent. Only half of those with severe PTSD report
  receiving any treatment and only a minority receive specialty mental health care.
  Striking disparities in PTSD treatment exist by country income level. Increasing
  access to effective treatment, especially in low- and middle-income countries, remains
  critical for reducing the population burden of PTSD.
