abstract: Background Personal vaporisers are gaining popularity as an alternative
  route of administration for a range of substances. Online cryptomarkets are becoming
  increasingly popular among people who use substances due to their perceived anonymity,
  ease of use, and reduced risk of violence compared to traditional face-to-face dealers.
  We examined the diversity of substances marketed for use in a personal vaporiser
  on these marketplaces. Methods Vaping related listings were extracted from three
  online cryptomarkets (‘Agartha’, ‘Cryptonia’, and ‘Tochka’) using The Onion Router
  browser. Data collection occurred between October and November 2019. Results We
  identified 1929 listings from 201 unique sellers. The top product on Agartha, Cryptonia,
  and Tochka were vape cartridges prefilled with the e-liquid (70.4 %, 39.4 %, 52.3
  % respectively). The most common substance in these products was cannabis oil (96.1
  %, 82.1 %, 87.8 %), followed by synthetic cannabinoids (3.7 %, 9.7 %, 9.8 %) and
  psychedelic substances (0.2 %, 6.4 %, 1.2 %). Vendors were primarily from the USA.
  Many products offered worldwide shipping (96.3 %, 42.4 %, 51.2 %). Conclusion Vaping
  products listed on online cryptomarkets in 2019 primarily contained cannabis oils.
  Future studies should continue to examine cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends
  of substances that can be used in personal vaporisers.
