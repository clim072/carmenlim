abstract: Background  This is the first cross-national study of intermittent explosive
  disorder (IED).    Method   A total of 17 face-to-face cross-sectional household
  surveys of adults were conducted in 16 countries (  n  = 88 063) as part of the
  World Mental Health Surveys initiative. The World Health Organization Composite
  International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) assessed DSM-IV IED, using a conservative
  definition.     Results  Lifetime prevalence of IED ranged across countries from
  0.1 to 2.7% with a weighted average of 0.8%; 0.4 and 0.3% met criteria for 12-month
  and 30-day prevalence, respectively. Sociodemographic correlates of lifetime risk
  of IED were being male, young, unemployed, divorced or separated, and having less
  education. The median age of onset of IED was 17 years with an interquartile range
  across countries of 13â€“23 years. The vast majority (81.7%) of those with lifetime
  IED met criteria for at least one other lifetime disorder; co-morbidity was highest
  with alcohol abuse and depression. Of those with 12-month IED, 39% reported severe
  impairment in at least one domain, most commonly social or relationship functioning.
  Prior traumatic experiences involving physical (non-combat) or sexual violence were
  associated with increased risk of IED onset.    Conclusions  Conservatively defined,
  IED is a low prevalence disorder but this belies the true societal costs of IED
  in terms of the effects of explosive anger attacks on families and relationships.
  IED is more common among males, the young, the socially disadvantaged and among
  those with prior exposure to violence, especially in childhood.
