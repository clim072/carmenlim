abstract: Abstract   Background  Previous work has identified associations between
  psychotic experiences (PEs) and general medical conditions (GMCs), but their temporal
  direction remains unclear as does the extent to which they are independent of comorbid
  mental disorders.    Methods  In total, 28 002 adults in 16 countries from the WHO
  World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys were assessed for PEs, GMCs and 21 Diagnostic
  and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) mental disorders.
  Discrete-time survival analyses were used to estimate the associations between PEs
  and GMCs with various adjustments.    Results  After adjustment for comorbid mental
  disorders, temporally prior PEs were significantly associated with subsequent onset
  of 8/12 GMCs (arthritis, back or neck pain, frequent or severe headache, other chronic
  pain, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and peptic ulcer) with odds ratios
  (ORs) ranging from 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–1.5] to 1.9 (95% CI 1.4–2.4).
  In contrast, only three GMCs (frequent or severe headache, other chronic pain and
  asthma) were significantly associated with subsequent onset of PEs after adjustment
  for comorbid GMCs and mental disorders, with ORs ranging from 1.5 (95% CI 1.2–1.9)
  to 1.7 (95% CI 1.2–2.4).    Conclusions  PEs were associated with the subsequent
  onset of a wide range of GMCs, independent of comorbid mental disorders. There were
  also associations between some medical conditions (particularly those involving
  chronic pain) and subsequent PEs. Although these findings will need to be confirmed
  in prospective studies, clinicians should be aware that psychotic symptoms may be
  risk markers for a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Whether PEs are causal
  risk factors will require further research.
