abstract: 'Background and Aims There has been an increase in the potency of cannabis
  during the last two decades and adoption of a novel method of administration—vaping.
  YouTube, a social media platform, has become a popular source to access cannabis-related
  information. This study aimed to identify cannabis vaping YouTube videos from 2016
  to 2020 and examine the themes and metrics. Design Cross-sectional sample of 200
  YouTube videos. Setting YouTube, an on-line video sharing platform. Measurements
  Videos related to cannabis vaping were identified using the search terms: ‘vaping
  cannabis’, ‘vaping weed’, ‘vaping marijuana’ and ‘vaping THC’ [tetrahydrocannabinol].
  Videos were independently coded by two researchers. The number of views, likes,
  dislikes and comments were also collected. Robust regression was used to analyse
  the relationship between identified video themes and video metrics. Findings Six
  themes were identified: ‘advertisement’, ‘product review’, ‘celebratory’, ‘reflective’,
  ‘how-to’ and ‘warning’. The ‘how-to’ and ‘celebratory’ videos received the highest
  number of views and likes. The most popular video was viewed more than 4 000 000
  times. Many videos portrayed risky behaviour (e.g. vaping a whole THC cartridge
  in a single setting). Fifty-two percent of these videos had no age access restrictions.
  The robust regression model also found that engagement metric was positively associated
  with ‘reflective’ videos and negatively associated with ‘advertisement’ videos.
  Conclusions A large number of videos on cannabis vaping are available on-line without
  age-restriction. Videos that portrayed risky behaviour appear to be prevalent.'
