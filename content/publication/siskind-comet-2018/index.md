abstract: Introduction  Clozapine, while effective in treatment refractory schizophrenia,
  is associated with significant weight gain, heart disease and increased risk of
  type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although there is evidence for weight loss with
  metformin for people with obesity who are already taking clozapine, there have been
  no published trials that have investigated the effect of metformin in attenuating
  weight gain at the time of clozapine initiation.    Methods and analysis  A 24-week
  double-blind placebo-controlled trial of concomitant prescription of metformin at
  clozapine commencement. Eighty-six people being commenced on clozapine will be randomised
  to placebo or metformin (variable dose, up to 2 g/day). The primary outcome is comparative
  end point body weight, between the placebo and metformin groups. Secondary outcomes
  are comparative rates of conversion to T2DM, alteration of metabolic syndrome parameters,
  proportion gaining textgreater5% body weight and changes in diet and appetite. We
  will additionally examine biomarkers associated with change in weight among trial
  participants.    Ethics and dissemination  Ethics approval was granted by the Metro
  South Human Research Ethics Committee HREC/17/QPAH/538-SSA/17/QPAH/565. We plan
  to submit a manuscript of the results to a peer-reviewed journal, and present results
  at conferences, consumer forums and hospital grand rounds.    Trial registration
