After 2 rounds of revisions, the paper was finally accepted and published in [**Addiction**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.15424). Happy days given Addiction's acceptance rate is ~10%. I could not be more thankful to my advisory team and peers for all their support and help. ðŸ¦„âœ¨ 

I have created a video abstract to summarize my entire study.

Kristy from HABS also helped to write a [media release](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2021/02/call-tougher-age-restrictions-youtube-vaping-cannabis-videos) for this study which is a great way to increase the impact of my study. Thanks Kristy!

Shortly after the study was published, the study has garnered quite a bit of attention in the press.

The publication of this paper also coincides with low-dose cannabidiol oil (CBD) being approved over-the-counter sale. 4zzz has asked if we were available for an interview. I bravely took that as a challenge and did my 1st ever radio interview. Here is the access to the [interview](https://www.4zzzfm.org.au/program/brisbane-line/2021-02-11%2012:00:00?fbclid=IwAR2nTOTTFRP54wyvRbhdj6doqP5aNJxAr6PCIcH-EZqHxTXFHCbFIx29S98).
