After 2 rounds of revision, the paper was finally accepted and published in [**Addiction**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.15424). Happy days! I could not be more thankful to my advisory team and peers for all their support and help. ü¶Ñ‚ú® 

Kristy from UQ HABS also helped to write a media release for this study. It really helped to amplify the story and increase the impact of my study.  Thanks Kristy!

Gary, my primary supervisor did an interview with the news outlet. The study has garnered quite a bit of attention in the press.

The publication of this paper also coincides with low-dose cannabidiol oil (CBD) being approved over-the-counter sale. 4zzz has asked if we were available for an interview. I bravely took that as a challenge and did my 1st ever radio interview. Here is the access to the [interview](https://www.4zzzfm.org.au/program/brisbane-line/2021-02-11%2012:00:00?fbclid=IwAR2nTOTTFRP54wyvRbhdj6doqP5aNJxAr6PCIcH-EZqHxTXFHCbFIx29S98).
